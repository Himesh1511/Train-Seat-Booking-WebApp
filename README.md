# Train-Seat-Booking-WebApp
A Train Seat Booking App that allows users to reserve 1-7 seats in a coach with 80 seats. It prioritizes booking in a single row, and if unavailable, books nearby seats. The app ensures real-time seat availability, alerts for invalid bookings, and supports visual representation of seat statuses.
Features:
Seat Availability: The app tracks 80 seats in the coach, with 3 seats reserved for the last row.
Seat Booking: Users can book between 1 to 7 seats at a time. The system prioritizes booking seats in a single row, and if that is not possible, it will book nearby seats across rows.
Booking Validation: Ensures that only available seats can be booked and that no more than 7 seats can be reserved at a time.
User-Friendly Alerts: Provides alerts for invalid seat bookings (e.g., booking more than available or attempting to book an incorrect number of seats).
Real-Time Updates: Seat statuses are updated to reflect whether a seat is available or booked, offering real-time feedback.
Visual Representation: The seat layout can be displayed visually with seat statuses shown in the UI, indicating which seats are available and which are booked.
