# Train-Seat-Booking-WebApp
A Train Seat Booking App that allows users to reserve 1-7 seats in a coach with 80 seats. It prioritizes booking in a single row, and if unavailable, books nearby seats. The app ensures real-time seat availability, alerts for invalid bookings, and supports visual representation of seat statuses.
